# Feature Update: Targeting & Volume Estimates

## 🌍 New Targeting Inputs
We've added two new optional fields to the configuration card:
1. **Target Region**: Specify a location (e.g., "UK", "USA", "Germany") to get localized keywords (e.g., "trousers" vs "pants").
2. **Timeframe/Season**: Specify a season or event (e.g., "Christmas", "Summer", "Q4") to get trending or seasonal keywords.

## 📊 AI Volume Potential
Instead of generating fake search volume numbers (which AI cannot do accurately), we now provide an **Estimated Volume Potential**:
- **High**: Broad appeal, likely high traffic (Green)
- **Medium**: Niche or specific intent (Yellow)
- **Low**: Very specific long-tail or low demand (Grey)

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Enter your URL.
2. (Optional) Add a Region (e.g., "London") and Season (e.g., "Winter").
3. Click **Analyze**.
4. Review the "Est. Volume" column to prioritize your list.
5. Copy the best keywords and paste them into **Google Keyword Planner** for exact data.
